possible to enrich their minds with a spark of passion for the sciences. The event will involve numerous student organizations 

across all fields of science, who will promote their respective field to the public through interactive and fun activities. We 

welcome all students of Rutgers as well as the general public from surrounding communities to join us for a day of just science.</h2>

        <p class="lead">Keynote Speaker</p>
        <h5>An American aerospace engineer and author, best known for his advocacy of the manned exploration of Mars. He was the driving force behind Mars Direct—a proposal intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission. The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey. A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their "design reference mission". He questions the delay and cost-to-benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Apollo Program-like return to the Moon, as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen, water, or energy; these resources are producible on Mars, and he expects people would be there thereafter.</h5>

        <p class="lead">Physics</p>
        <h5>Maiullo creates entertaining demonstrations that physics professors use to convey hard-to-grasp scientific principles. First-year physics students, for example, may witness frozen flowers shatter like glass, a person lying on a bed of nails or a professor rocketing himself around the lecture hall on roller skates with a fire extinguisher. Maiullo views his role as equal parts teacher, technician and performer. He first needs to understand what concepts the professor is trying to convey, then creates demonstrations that are catchy and easy to see from the top of the hall’s amphitheatre-style seating gallery. Before the lecture he rehearses the professor in using the demo and will occasionally assist during class. Maiullo oversees a part-time staff of 10 students who help him build the demos and manage a treasure-trove of instruments and materials housed under the seating area in back of the building. </h5>

        <p class="lead">Activity</p>
        <h5>Ever been told not to look directly at the Sun? Well, the Astronomical Society says otherwise. Referred to as solar observing, we will allow audience members to look directly at the Sun through two of our 8’’ optical telescopes equipped with solar filters. During the nighttime observing session, come see the vastness of our galaxy by learning about the different constellations. We will be displaying various solar and celestial objects through the use of our telescopes as well as “pointing" them out with our high-powered green laser. Take home pictures of what you observed by using our smartphone adapters. We look forward to sharing our passion for astronomy and stargazing with you!</h5>

        To demonstrate some of the topics cognitive scientists are interested in, we will present a series of illusions that test aspects of vision and body representation in the brain. These include the Rubber Hand Illusion and a mirrored body transfer illusion, both interactive activities that reveal information about the mechanisms of our perception and self-consciousness. Through these demos we hope to spark interest in the field and provide insights into the incredible progress being made to understand and expand our cognitive abilities.</h5>

His research interests are in human and machine vision, neural mechanisms in vision, image processing, imaging systems, and scientific visualization techniques. He is investigating the mechanisms that underlie the perception of visual motion, stereopsis, texture, and the deployment of attention in vision. In particular, he studies the role of visual attributes (color, luminance, shape, spatial frequency, etc.) in perception, with the ultimate goal of developing quantitative models of biological mechanisms in these modalities.</h5>

In addition to our two big events that we plan on a semesterly basis, USACS runs Code Red every Friday from 3pm to 5pm in Hill 252, a program set up for 111 and 112 students to come in and get free tutoring from USACS members. After Code Red at 6pm we hold a weekly Hacker Hour session. Each Hacker Hour an upper classmen teaches an awesome subject that CS students would normally never get to learn in the standard CS curriculum.

USACS also manages a mentoring program that connects aspiring underclassmen CS students with experience upperclassmen who can teach them practical job-oriented CS skills. If you're interested in being mentored, come to Hacker hour and speak with one of the organizers about getting paired up!</h5>
